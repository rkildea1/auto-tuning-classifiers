# Fine tuning an SVM algorithm
Goal: find the optimum param's for my SVM algorithm 
Code funtion: Loop through predefined hyperparameters and fit the estimator (model) on the training set
Note: You can swap out the SVM code and param's for other algorithms pretty easy here guys.. 

Depending on the Algoirthm and the params you test, it should print the below:
